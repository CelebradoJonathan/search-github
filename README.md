# listdir
This program accepts a desired path and a desired filename, then use the directory to recursively collect data then print in a csv file.

To run the program: open the terminal, then go to the directory of the file then type : "python listdir.py <directory> <filename>"


Note: If the program encounters an inaccessible file the csv file will stop printing in that particular file. Sorry for the inconvinience, 
I'll fix this as soon as I know how to.
